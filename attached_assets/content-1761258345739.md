# Standard metaobject definitions

Standard metaobject definitions are [metaobject definitions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data/metaobjects/manage-metaobjects) with a specific `type` that we've reserved. Standard metaobject definitions have pre-configured [access grants](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data/permissions), a known set of [metaobject fields](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data), and preconfigured [capabilities](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data/metaobjects/use-metaobject-capabilities). Standards ensure interoperability across the Shopify ecosystem.

Note

The [Shopify standard taxonomy](https://github.com/Shopify/product-taxonomy) is a suite of standard metaobject definitions that's used to store and manage product taxonomy categories and attributes. [Learn how to integrate your app with the Shopify standard product taxonomy](https://github.com/Shopify/product-taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#-1-integrators-how-to-integrate-with-the-taxonomy).

The following table lists available standard metaobject definitions:

| - | - | - | - | - |
| Product Review | `2` | `product_review` | Stores and manages product reviews, including ratings, review content, and associated metadata. **This metaobject definition is only available to approved partners.
