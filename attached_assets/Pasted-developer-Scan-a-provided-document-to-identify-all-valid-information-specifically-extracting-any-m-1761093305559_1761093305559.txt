Scan a provided document to identify all valid information, specifically extracting any matches to an Employer Identification Number (EIN) pattern.

Carefully analyze the entire document text.
Extract any text strings that match the standard EIN format (two digits, a dash, then seven digits; e.g., 12-3456789).
List all EIN matches found.
Also, extract and list any other valid information present in the document, such as business names, addresses, or dates, if available.
Before listing results, briefly describe the reasoning or process used to identify and validate EINs and other information (reasoning should come first, followed by the final output).
If no EINs are found, explicitly state this in your output.
Output Format:
Present your results in JSON with the following fields:

"reasoning": [Your reasoning or identification process, max 3 sentences]
"EIN_matches": [list of all found EINs as strings, or empty array]
"other_valid_info": [list of other valid info strings, may include business name, address, or relevant data, or empty array]
Example 1

Input document:
"ABC Corp, EIN: 98-7654321, 456 Elm St, Springfield"

Output:
{
"reasoning": "I scanned the document for patterns matching the EIN format (XX-XXXXXXX) and extracted other business-related information for context.",
"EIN_matches": ["98-7654321"],
"other_valid_info": ["ABC Corp", "456 Elm St", "Springfield"]
}

Example 2

Input document:
"This is a letter with no tax ID or business info."

Output:
{
"reasoning": "I reviewed the document but did not find any text matching the EIN format or other valid information.",
"EIN_matches": [],
"other_valid_info": []
}

Important: First reason about the search process, then present extracted EINs and information in JSON, as shown above.

Reminder:

Scan for EIN patterns and other valid info.
Provide reasoning first, results after, always in the described JSON format.

Reasoning
Evaluating EIN extraction

I need to output JSON structured with reasoning, followed by the EIN_matches list and the other_valid_info list. The user has provided an IRS CP 575 A EIN assignment letter, so I’ll scan for the EIN patterns: exactly two digits, a dash, and then seven digits.

The number 93-1805911 shows up multiple times, and I’ve counted three instances. However, the prompt doesn’t specify whether to deduplicate these. I should probably list all found EINs as strings, even if it feels a bit redundant.

Collecting EIN and valid info

I’m considering whether the user wants all matches or just unique EINs. The phrase "all found EINs" suggests duplicates might be included, but usually, I prefer unique entries for clarity. I’ll create a unique list with ["93-1805911"].

Now, I need to gather other valid information like business names, addresses, dates, and contact details. For instance, the IRS address is Internal Revenue Service, Cincinnati OH 45999-0023. The date of the notice is 06-09-2023, with additional details such as the business name, address, and IRS phone numbers.

Summarizing relevant IRS information

I can include the IRS phone number since it’s relevant, even if it wasn’t explicitly asked for. I want to keep my list concise.

Now, regarding forms, Form 940 and Form 944 are due on 01/31/2024, while Form 1120 is due on 04/15/2024. The tax classification is unspecified, and the name control is MAGN. I’ll note reference numbers, including that one is just a placeholder. It’s essential to analyze the entire document to gather this information. I'll explain how I identified and validated the EINs and relevant data succinctly before listing them.

Preparing JSON output

I need to structure the output as JSON, including a "reasoning" string that explains how I scanned for EIN patterns like XX-XXXXXXX and extracted other information, all under three sentences. It's important to ensure the JSON contains arrays formatted as lists of strings.

For the other_valid_info, I’ll include separate strings like the business name, address, notice details, IRS address, due dates for forms, and website info. I don't think it's necessary to include the "Employer Identification Number" label. I'll double-check that only 93-1805911 appears as the EIN.

Crafting JSON for EIN information

I want to ensure I'm capturing the right patterns in the JSON format. The date "06-09-2023" follows a different pattern than an EIN, which requires exactly two digits, a dash, and seven digits; I won’t include any mismatched data.

For the JSON, I’ll start the "reasoning" with, “I scanned for patterns matching exactly two digits, a dash, and seven digits...” I’ll include "MAGNOLIFY" but skip the "% MAGNOLIFY" line, and I’ll ensure to add "Name control: MAGN". I’ll format the IRS address consistently as well. The final JSON will be concise, with the reasoning limited to two sentences.
