          "text": "Return a single US business profile as a JSON object that perfectly matches the provided JSON Schema specification below.\n\n- Search and confirm the business’s existence in US sources ONLY. Ignore companies in other countries, even if the name is similar or the same.\n- Use only official and authoritative sources, prioritizing in this order:\n    1. The company’s official website\n    2. US state/government business registries\n    3. Verified business listing platforms\n- Do NOT use generic directories unless the above are unavailable.\n- If you find conflicting data, choose the information from the freshest (most recently updated) and most authoritative source. If uncertainty persists, set the field to null.\n- If no matching US business exists with the name, return an object with ALL fields set to null.\n\nBefore providing your answer:\n- Think step-by-step through which sources you check, how you assess US relevance, and how you resolve conflicts for any ambiguous data.\n- Summarize your chain of reasoning in a \"reasoning\" field.\n- The completed JSON must be strictly valid per the schema: all required fields present, all values matching their regex/pattern constraints, no additional properties.\n- The only allowable output is the JSON object (without explanations or commentary).\n\n### Output format:\nProduce your response as a single, compact JSON object matching exactly this structure. All fields must be included, strictly comply with the specified types/patterns, and do not output extra properties.\n\n### JSON Schema (for your reference – the output you generate must adhere to this structure):\n\n{\n  \"website\": \"string|null (must start with https:// if not null, uri format)\",\n  \"instagramHandle\": \"string|null (must start with @ if not null)\",\n  \"businessAddress\": \"string|null\",\n  \"businessAddress2\": \"string|null\",\n  \"city\": \"string|null\",\n  \"state\": \"string|null (2 upper-case letter state code)\",\n  \"zipCode\": \"string|null (5 or 9 digit US zip)\",\n  \"phone\": \"string|null (US format: (999) 999-9999)\"\n}\n\nInclude a \"reasoning\" string: Summarize briefly (1–3 sentences) the key steps, how sources/ties were resolved, and if/why any fields are null.\n\n### Example\n\n**Input:** \"Fred\"s Carpet Cleaning\"\n\n**Output:**\n{\n  \"website\": \"https://fredscarpetcleaning.com\",\n  \"instagramHandle\": \"@fredscarpetcleaning\",\n  \"businessAddress\": \"123 Elm St\",\n  \"businessAddress2\": null,\n  \"city\": \"Denver\",\n  \"state\": \"CO\",\n  \"zipCode\": \"80202\",\n  \"phone\": \"(303) 555-1234\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Located matching business on official website and state registry. Website data agreed with registry; confirmed US-only. BusinessAddress2 was not listed anywhere so set null.\"\n}\n\n**Input:** \"Petra Ltd\"  \n**Output:**\n{\n  \"website\": null,\n  \"instagramHandle\": null,\n  \"businessAddress\": null,\n  \"businessAddress2\": null,\n  \"city\": null,\n  \"state\": null,\n  \"zipCode\": null,\n  \"phone\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Searched official US registries, company website, and verified sources. No US business by this name found; left all fields null.\"\n}\n\n### Important Reminders\n- Include \"reasoning\" last, after all profile fields.\n- Do not give any output besides the required JSON object.\n- Adhere strictly to the schema—any violation is an error.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder: Return one US business profile as a strict JSON object per schema; search US sources only; reasoning always appears after the profile fields; never describe or output anything else.**"
